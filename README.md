# Football Match Outcome Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the outcomes of football matches based on historical data from various sources like FIFA, Transfermarkt, and others. The model leverages the power of PyTorch to train a fully connected neural network (FCNN) that can predict match results based on team statistics, player lineups, and past performances.
